# CS-255-Driver-Pass-Documentation
The Driver Pass project was an online driving school system. This system would allow users to buy driving lesson packages, schedule those lessons, take practice exams, and more. The system would allow students, secretaries, driving instructors, and other staff to manage their own unique accounts. This project displays the business requirements collected and organized categorically, as well as interpreted into several UML diagrams. It’s important to consider the user’s needs when designing a system so as not to stray off track and also to appeal to their wants as they are the general audience. 
 I also learned from now on to create UML diagrams to plan my code before developing it, as diagrams such as class diagrams are skilled at highlighting relationships and attributes within the code.
