# CS-255-Driver-Pass-Documentation
## Project Overview
The Driver Pass project was meant to demonstrate understanding of the AGILE analysis and design steps in the Software Development Lifecycle. Driver Pass was a fictional online driving school management system with the requirements of: streamlining the process of purchasing driving lesson packages, scheduling lessons, taking practice exams, and managing user accounts. This system design caters to multiple user roles, including students, secretaries, driving instructors, and other staff members, each with unique account functionalities.

## Purpose and Goals
The primary objective of this project was to analyze and design a user-friendly system that meets the specific needs of its users while ensuring efficiency and ease of access. This document presents the business requirements, categorically organized and visually represented through UML diagrams, aiding in system architecture and planning.

## System Design Approach
To ensure a well-structured system, UML diagrams were used, including:

Use Case Diagrams: To visualize system interactions for different user roles.
Class Diagrams: To define system structure, relationships, and attributes before development.
Sequence Diagrams: To model the flow of interactions within key system processes.
